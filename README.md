## Fuzzy Logic to Emulate Empathy 

1. Recongize emotional states in degrees

Instead of it being "sad"/"happy"/etc <br>
It would be: 

- "slightly sad"
- "very sad"
- "somewhat anxious"
- "extremly anxious"
- etc

2. Contextual decision making with fuzzy sets

- Adaptive Response Levels

Example: <br>
*Emotion Detected:* Moderatly Anxious 
*Chatbot Response Angled:* Provide mild reasurance 

- Empathy Scaling
