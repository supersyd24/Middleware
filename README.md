## Fuzzy Logic to Emulate Empathy 

### Benifits of using Fuzzy Logic as an additional system apart from a LLM

1. Recongize emotional states in degrees

Instead of it being "sad"/"happy"/etc <br>
It would be: 

- "slightly sad"
- "very sad"
- "somewhat anxious"
- "extremly anxious"
- etc

2. Contextual decision making with fuzzy sets

- Adaptive Response Levels

Example: <br>
*Emotion Detected:* Moderatly Anxious 
*Chatbot Response Angled:* Provide mild reasurance 

- Empathy Scaling 

3. Adjusting Tone and Language with Fuzzy Logic

4. Handling Vague Emotional Expression 

5. Building Trust: Human-like Interaction
